# 1. About the project
The main idea of this project is to develop an application that will collect and integrate information about companies, using API from opencorporates.com and crunchbase.com. Information about companies is available in JSON format.
After the data is collected, it is transformed to RDF format and stored into an RDF   repository. Access to the collected data is enabled through RESTful services.
Application workflow consists of the following phases:

*	A custom made JSON parser retrieves and parses company data from both data sources.
*	The extracted data is transformed into RDF triplets based on the Schema.org (schema:Organization)  vocabulary
*	Data is persisted into an RDF repository
*	Access to the data is enabled through RESTful services

# 2.	Domain model

Data about companies from the opencorporates.com and crunchbase.com websites are analyzed in order to determine which classes and properties from the schema:Oraganization vocabulary are supported. Based on that analysis, domain model, depicted on Figure 1, is created.

Figure 1. Domain model

Class Organization contains basic information about a company. This includes name of the company, founding date, description, location of the company, employees.  An organization is linked to its employees (class Person), and its location (class PostalAddress).
Class Person contains employeeâ€™s name and job title.
Class PostalAddress contains information about address of the company, such as street address and country of the company.
#3.	The solution

Both CrunchBase and OpenCorporates have their own API for accessing data. In order to use API from crunchbase.com , it is necessary to sign up to get an API key. 
The data obtained through the two APIs is further transformed into RDF triplets based on schema:Organization vocabulary, and resulting triplets are persisted into an RDF repository. The application allows access to that data through the following RESTful services:
/employees- returns all types of employees in JSON format
/countries- returns all countries in JSON format
/findOrg - returns information about companies filtered by the specified criteria

The following screenshots illustrate filtering based on the country that companies operate in (Figure 2), and filtering based on both the country and partially specified company name (Figure 3).
Figure 4 illustrates the information the application provides about a specific company.
