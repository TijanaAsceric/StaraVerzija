Like most advisory professionals, we spent the vast majority of our time creating pitchbooks, the primary vehicles for communicating insights and proposing ideas to clients. In fact, we personally created and presented over 15,000 of them. We know firsthand how tedious and painful the pitchbook creation process is. It is expensive and slow and involves a small army of people using outdated technology.\n\nInvestment banks spend about $40,000 per pitchbook. An exorbitant percentage of that cost is time spent on tedious, inefficient manual tasks. This lost time detracts significantly from time spent with clients, and is a constant source of acute frustration to advisory professionals who are not using and developing critical skills.\n\nWe came up with a better way. Drawing on our experience, and our frustration with the status quo, we are introducing new technologies that will streamline workflows and empower valuable personnel rather than depleting them.\n\nOur investment banking pedigree allowed us to gain a unique perspective into the way work actually gets done in these organizations, and the specific content required. An ongoing consulting relationship with a bulge bracket investment bank has helped guide our product development over the last two years, and serves as proof of concept of Pellucid’s ability to increase throughput and introduce operational leverage. Thus, the first Pellucid toolkit is designed specifically for investment bankers, containing domain-specific knowledge, market data, curated analytics, and visualizations. In future toolkits, we will expand to other markets, such as asset management and management consulting.\n"^^xsd:string ;

Sadly we are generally forced to opt for option 3.\n\n\nHere is the fourth lucrative option:\n\n* 1, Login to www.indiaonapage.com , go to your city page and get all the information you want.\n\n\nThink of another scenario: It is Friday evening; you are back from hard work at office, thinking about how to spend the precious weekend. Alas! You have no clue of what to do. Again you have 3 options:\n\n* Call Reeta, Ganesh , Amit or Sheeta to check if they are free.\n* Hunt newspaper to see if you get any idea to spend weekend.\n* Stick to your favorite time pass (sleeping).\n\n  Here is the fourth lucrative option:\n\n* 1, Login to www.indiaonapage.com, go to your city page and get all the information you want about movies, events etc.\n\n\nThese are not fictitious scenarios but real time scenarios. Most of us really face such scenarios in our life. ï¿½Necessity is mother of inventionï¿½, so is IndiaOnAPage.

Shryk has developed the first three flavors, and these are directed at Youth (5 to 11 years old) Teen (12 to 17 years old) and Young Adults (18 to 24 years old.)  The system allows users to manage their own bank accounts and be trained in financial literacy at the same time. The Shryk system may be the silver bullet that has been missing in the battle against the issues the US is having with financial literacy. At the same time, we provide a business solution to the banking and credit union industries to start the customer for life paradigm with young kids in a way that provides a whole new set of products for the financial industry.\n\nThe second half of this model is that Shryk provides access to the platform to schools and teachers for free, through the weProsper.org community site.  This allows a city to start kids in kindergarten with a simulated banking platform that looks exactly like what they will be able to use at a bank with real money when they choose. Not only does this enable schools to teach financial literacy on a sophisticated online delivery system for free, it also provides the onramp to drive new customers to our banking customers. The combination of both sides of this model is being hailed by many people in the financial literacy world as a possible breakthrough use of technology.  Shryk is enabling win-win public/private partnerships between financial institutions, schools, and parents in a way that is financially feasible for all.  While providing an environment for young people to manage their own finances in a way they simply cannot do at this time.\n\nShryk solves the following specific problems:\n1. A solution for teaching financial literacy at the point of transaction that is robust and unique.  This is critical because of statistics such as the fact that approx. 25% of the personal bankruptcies in the US are filed by people 25 years old or less.\n2. A service that helps banks and credit unions make more money through saving them costs on servicing small kids account on paper, making stickier relationships with parents, and providing an avenue for additional fee revenue\n3. A free tool for schools to teach financial literacy.  Many are being mandated to do this by their state government, yet are getting no funds to implement it.\n\nFuture flavors that are being planned will target senior citizens, the Spanish community, and young married couples.\n"^^xsd:string ;

        schema:description   "In early 2009, brothers Jarred and Adam Mait learned that their father was suddenly killed in a car accident by a convicted drug offender. In the wake of this tragedy, the brothers were thrown into an uncomfortable role of overseeing legal issues associated with organizing their father&#39;s files and identifying the most qualified accountant and attorney. The ensuing path led the Maits to discover financial assets they never even knew their father had.\n\nThe experience inspired the brothers to form Knowtification, a service that works at a family&#39;s request to settle the affairs of a loved one by notifying hundreds of institutions of the event. These institutions include banks, life insurance companies, credit bureaus, brokerage and securities firms as well as 401(k) plan administrators. The result is a way for those closest to the deceased to identify which financial assets are in their loved one&#39;s name without fumbling through records.\n\nIn addition to its main service, Knowtification helps clients with providing a centralized location where friends and family can obtain information related to the funeral and other mourning events. For this very purpose, on the company&#39;s website at knowtification.com, Knowtification enables family members to create a free funeral registry and memorial page.\n\nKnowtification offers two levels of its main service, a Basic level at $59.95 in which the company contacts over 200 institutions and a Premium level at $89.95 in which Knowtification contacts over 400 institutions.\n"^^xsd:string ;
